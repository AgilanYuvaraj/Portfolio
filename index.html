 <p class="about"><span></span>Hello! I’m Agilan, an enthusiastic IT student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. Currently pursuing my degree in B.Tech IT at Mahendra Engineering college, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and I am experienced in web development using HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React. My projects have allowed me to develop skills in cyber security analysis.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a proactive learner who thrives in collaborative environments. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and constantly seek opportunities to expand my expertise through internships and personal projects.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or attending tech meetups to connect with like-minded individuals.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss technology, projects, or collaboration opportunities!.
